Optimizing Quarkus for OLTP

This talk demonstrates our challenge in optimizing Quakus to be competitive in a competition from the Brazillian community, where we had to implement a simple transaction processing backend and make it as fast as possible, with severe resource limitations. With only 1.5 CPU units and 550MB RAM for the entire architecture, we had to squeeze performance anywhere imaginable.

In this session, we'll dive deep into the solution and how to build extremely lightweight containers using QuarkusIO, GraalVM, PostgreSQL, and NGINX. We'll explore the code, run the Gatling load simulation, share the results, and everything else. Join us and let's have fun squeezing performance out of applications!
