Well-Architected Kubernetes

"Well-architected", for this talk, means our systems can handle more work, are less likely to break, and can be managed more easily. We'll go over how to evaluate a system's architecture and ways to make it better. For many real-world use cases, part of the answer is adopting Kubernetes.

Kubernetes helps manage how applications run across many computers, but it needs to be set up right to work well. We'll share tips on how to do this, focusing on making it secure, efficient, and easy to use.

We'll use Red Hat OpenShift as a reference implementation of those concepts. OpenShift builds on Kubernetes to offer more features, especially for enterprise scenarios. By looking at how OpenShift is put together, we can see practical examples of good architecture in action. This will help anyone looking to improve their own systems with Kubernetes. Join us to learn, share, and apply these principles to your own Kubernetes projects.
