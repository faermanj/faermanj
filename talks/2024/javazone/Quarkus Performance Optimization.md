Performance Optimization with Quarkus

This talk demonstrates performance and cost optimizatons ideas for Java applications, focusing on low-latency transactional systems that utilize relational databases. We explore the utilization of Quarkus and GraalVM, a Java stack that excels in creating lightweight, high-performance applications. It reduces the startup time and also minimizes the memory footprint of applications, making them ideal for cloud deployment. Additionally, we delve into generating compact and secure container images, further optimizing resource efficiency and facilitating cloud operations. The session is designed for developers and architects aiming to enhance their Java applications with cutting-edge optimizations for cloud readiness and operational efficiency.



This session is built for software developers, application architects, and system administrators involved in developing, deploying, and managing Java applications, especially those optimizing for cloud environments.
