In the learning curve as a software engineer, there is quite a gap between learning a programing language and becoming able to deliver a project. In Java, for example, after we learn about object oriented programming and the standard library, usually comes object relational mapping, connection management, frameworks and all that jazz. This talk demonstrates how to deliver Java web applicaitons with Quarkus and AWS, quickly and effectively.

In the journey of becoming a software engineer, there's often a significant gap between learning a programming language and actually delivering an entire project. For Java developers, as an example, after mastering object-oriented programming and the standard library, the next steps typically involve tackling object-relational mapping, connection management, and various libraries and frameworks. This talk focuses on bridging that gap by demonstrating how to quickly and effectively deliver Java web applications using Quarkus and AWS, helping developers streamline the process from coding to production.
