How to help people be sucessful in technology?
In this session, I'd like to share some reliable and repeatable practices for helping people with their careers in technology organizations. It's a simple method, based on decades of mentoring with hundreds of candidates, interviews and career growth experiences. We'll work on four areas:
* Health & Balance
* Programming & Algorithms
* Communication & Behavior
* Architecture & Design
Join this session and learn the practices to develop yourself and help others be successful.
