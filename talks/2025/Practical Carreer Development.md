# Engineering Yoga: Building as a Practice
This session summarizes more than 20 years in education, helping developers be successful worldwide. Like yoga, musical instruments, or sports, software engineering can be seen as a practice, not just a job. Furthermore, it is a group practice, where we train alone, but deliver together. That makes interpersonal skills and the ability to work in a team as important as technical skills. For that reason, we divide the exercises into four areas:
* Health & Balance: Ensuring a sustainable long-term career, with a healthy work-life balance and positive mindset.
* Programming & Algorithms: Improving your technical skills, from the basics to advanced topics, including algorithms and design patterns.
* Communication & Behavior: Developing writing, speaking, performance evaluation, and other interpersonal skills.
* Architecture & Design: Understanding the big picture, from system architecture to reliable application integration.
If you would like to help others take the next step in their careers, the practices presented here can be a great starting point. They will provide you with the resources and methods to grow as a mentor and a developer.
