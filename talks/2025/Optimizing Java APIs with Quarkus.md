Who doesn't love a friendly challenge?
Recently, in the Brazillian community we had a "backend alley fight" (@rinhadebackend), where developers had to build and optimize a transactional API to support a high volume of transactions with minimal resources. As a Quarkus enthusiast, I could only wonder how well could we go.
In this session, we'll dive deep into the solution and how to build extremely lightweight containers using QuarkusIO, GraalVM, PostgreSQL, and NGINX. We'll explore the code, run the Gatling load simulation, share the results, and everything else. Join us and let's have fun squeezing performance out of systems!
