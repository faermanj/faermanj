"Well-architected" is a modern approach to improve our systems to handle more work, become less likely to break, and be managed more easily. It was originally proposed by AWS, and currently available in Azure and other technology providers. We'll go over the framework and how to evaluate a system's architecture and ways to make it better. For many real-world use cases, part of the answer is adopting Kubernetes and related open-source projects.

Kubernetes helps manage how applications run across many computers, but it needs to be set up right to work well. We'll share tips on how to do this, focusing on making it secure, efficient, and easy to use.

We'll use open-source projects as a reference implementation of all the design principles and best practices. By looking at how Red Hat OpenShift is built, we can see practical examples of good architecture in action. This will help anyone looking to improve their own systems with Kubernetes. Join us to learn, share, and apply these principles to your own Kubernetes projects.
