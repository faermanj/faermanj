I'm a software engineer at Red Hat and a career mentor at Caravana Cloud. As a member of the OpenShift team, I've been working to improve the developer experience of Kubernetes, especially on AWS. Previously, I built my experience working with global technology enterprises, including Amazon, JBoss, and Borland, as well as their customers and partners.

I also participate actively in developer communities, events, and publications worldwide. At Caravana Cloud, we help developers take the next step in their careers by mentoring each other and practicing collectively. Besides working, I love exploring Catalonia with my family, cycling roads, cooking, and playing a little guitar.
