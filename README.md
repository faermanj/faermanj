I'm a software engineer, working at Red Hat OpenShift, and a career mentor. My current job is to improve the architecture and integration of our Kubernetes platform, especially on AWS. Previously, I built my experience working with global technology enterprises, including Amazon, JBoss, and Borland, as well as their customers and partners.
I also participate actively in developer communities, events, and helping people take the next step in their careers in tech.  Besides working, I love exploring Catalonia, cycling, cooking, and playing a little guitar.
