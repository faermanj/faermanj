I am a software engineer and instructor dedicated to helping professionals thrive in technology careers. My experience comes primarily from working with global technology leaders such as Red Hat and Amazon — and even the legendary Borland — as well as supporting their customers and partners worldwide.

Most recently, I have been contributing to open-source initiatives in the Kubernetes ecosystem—particularly Cluster API—on behalf of the OpenShift team. My journey in software development began in the early 1990s, spanning experiences from garage startups to world-class enterprises.

Beyond engineering, I am an active contributor to developer communities, publications, and conferences. Outside of work, you’ll likely find me cycling through Catalonia, cooking, or playing a bit of guitar.
