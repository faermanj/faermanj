I am a professional software engineer and career mentor, helping people succeed in technology jobs. My experience comes from working with global technology leaders — including Red Hat, Amazon, and Borland — as well as their customers and partners. I am also an active contributor to developer communities, publications, and conferences. Outside of work, I enjoy cycling through Catalonia, cooking, and playing a little guitar.
