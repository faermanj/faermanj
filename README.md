I'm a software engineer at Red Hat and a career mentor. As a member of the OpenShift team, my role is to improve our Kubernetes platform, especially regarding cloud providers' integration. Coming from the Brazilian Java community, I'm also a Quarkus enthusiast. Previously, I built my experience working with global technology enterprises, including Amazon, JBoss, and Borland, as well as their customers and partners. I also participate actively in developer communities, helping people take their next career steps. Besides working, I love exploring Catalonia, cycling, cooking, and playing a little guitar.
